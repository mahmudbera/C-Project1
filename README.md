# C-Project1
Vector and Matrix Calculations

# Overview
This C project provides a comprehensive set of functions for creating, manipulating, and performing operations on vectors and matrices. The primary goal of this project is to offer a collection of tools that can be used for various mathematical computations involving matrices and vectors, often encountered in fields such as data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning.

The functions provided cover a wide range of operations, from basic memory management to advanced calculations like covariance and correlation. The dynamic memory allocation ensures flexibility and efficiency, allowing for the creation of vectors and matrices of varying sizes at runtime.
